# Welcome to BiblioTech

BiblioTech is an application for keeping track of your books. It keeps a list of books you enter and allows you to organize, filter, sort and print the list.

## Tags

Tags are labels that you create and assign to your books. They are a way to organize your book list by giving books labels that are important to you. Tags can be assigned when you add books to you list. They can also be added to and removed from books already in you list.

## Filters

Filters allow you to select which books to display based on the properties of each book. You can filter using assigned tags or by other properties like author, title or page count. You can also set the order you want to use to display books in a filter.

Filters can be named and saved, which will add them to your navigation pane to quickly show a specific set of books.

## Export and Import

BiblioTech can export and import CSV files containing books or saved filters. You can filter the books exported using any of your saved filters.

## Print

BiblioTech can print your list in a couple of fixed formats based on the paper size and number of columns you print. When printing you can also choose the text size and which properties you want to include in the printout.
