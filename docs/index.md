# Welcome to BiblioTech

BiblioTech is an application for keeping track of your books. It keeps a list of books you enter and allows you to organize, filter, sort and print the list.

BiblioTech uses tags to organize you books. You assign tags to books and then you can filter using the tags. You can filter based on whether a book has or doesn't have a specific set of tags.
