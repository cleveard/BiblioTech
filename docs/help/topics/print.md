Printing the book is organized in two steps.

- First you decide how the printout is formatted. You can choose the number of columns, the text size and which properties you want to include in the printout. The layout is chosen based on the width of a column in the printout.
- Then you use the system print service to print the list or save it to a PDF

<details><summary><li>Select the books to be printer</li></summary>
<p><a id="print-select"></a>

- Chose the filter to select the books to be printed. **\*\* All Books \*\*** will print all books in your book list unordered. The last filter you were displaying in the book list is chosen by default.
- Open the formatting settings to change the format of the printout
